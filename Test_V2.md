<summary><strong>Step 2: Starting the Emulator</strong></summary>

  1. From the menu select **Xilinx > Start/Stop Emulator**.  
  2. The Emulation dialog box appears. Select the appropriate Project and Configuration.  

  3. Select whether or not you want to show the waveform. Showing the waveform initiates a Vivado tools session with the simulation window open where you can view the waveform of the different signals within your design. Not showing the waveform results in faster emulation. Check the **Show the Waveform** option.  
  4. Click **Start**. This is equivalent to turning a board on.  
  5. Add the signals that need to be viewed in the Waveform viewer. This can be done by selecting the appropriate functions in the **Scope** window in Vivado, right-clicking and selecting **Add to Wave Window**. The signals within that function are then added to the waveform viewer.  

  6. Click on the **Run All** or **Run for** button to start the programmable logic simulation after selecting your signals.
